# MOD Arduino code
Currently the MOD is hard-coded.

MIDI.h and MOD.h can be used from the [generator script](https://github.com/batchku/MO/blob/master/PCBs/Processor/createFiles.py) but DO NOT replace [Arrays.h](https://github.com/batchku/MO/blob/master/Arduino/MOD/Arrays.h).

# Coming Soon...
Modular class system for each aspect of the hardware. Classes will include: 
1. Strip
2. Actuator
3. User Interface (for components on shield)

### Ignore (for now)
* Strip.cpp/Strip.h
* MOBasic.cpp/MOBasic.h
