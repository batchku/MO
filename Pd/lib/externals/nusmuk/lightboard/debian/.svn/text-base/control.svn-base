Description: Control DMX light with pure data
 "Lighting for Pure Data" is an abstractions collection for pure data
 that aims at emulating a lighting console controlling DMX systems.
 Unlike a hardware lighting console, this system offers an open API
 allowing a full control over the lighting within Pure Data in order
 to connect light with other media.
 This also allows to have complex light movements and behaviours.
