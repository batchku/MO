msd can be compiled in other dimension than 1D, 2D or 3D.

To do that, edit the main.cpp and the package.txt files in the msdND folder and replace "N" with the dimension you want.

For example, in 13D :

main.cpp file:
 
#include "../msd.h"
MSD("msd13D",msd13D,13)

package.txt file:

NAME=msd13D
SRCS=main.cpp
HDRS=../msd.h

And then compile using flext as usual. You call it in Max/PD using the name you entered, "msd13D" here.
