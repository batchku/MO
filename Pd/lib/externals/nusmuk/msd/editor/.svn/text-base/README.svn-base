msd-editor
------------

patched by Frank Barknecht <fbar@footils.org> with a big hand from Nicolas
Montgermont <montgermont@la-kitchen.fr> who wrote the msd2D and msd3D externals
required for using this patch. GEM is used to provide an alternative
visualization, but it is not required for the patch to work. 

If you want to export the messages to msd2d, that are created, you also need a
[prepend] external, preferably the one from the Cyclone library.

Thanks Nicolas for a great external colletion.

msd-editor.pd is the patch to open, further documentation is inside.
